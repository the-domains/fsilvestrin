# Born in São Paulo, Brazil. I mainly grew up in the countryside, a city known as Vinhedo. After winning a local Championship of the 3rd Division League of Amateur Football in my early twenties, It was time to retired. 

# My passion for art and design brought me into advertising. 

# After attending a renowned international advertising school I ended upin Hamburg, where I have been living for the past three and a half years.
